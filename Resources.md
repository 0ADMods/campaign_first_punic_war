**Chronology

- 265 B.C. - The Mamertines(they are described in the English article), under the attack of Hiero II of Syracuse who wanted to besiege them in Messana (Messina), ask for assistance to Carthage. The Syracusans having withdrawn, the Mamertines ask for help to Rome to enfranchise them from the Carthaginians.
- 264 B.C. - Disembarkation in Sicily of Roman forces led by Consul Appius Claudius Caudex. The Romans defeat in the battle of Messina first the Syracusans then the Carthaginians.
- 263 B.C. - Roman troops pass the Strait of Messina on boats furnished by Tarento (Τάρας in Greek and Tarentum in Latin),  Locri (Locris in Greek) and other Greek cities (from Great Greece=southern Italy occupied by the Greeks). The Carthaginians retreat to Agrigentum (Ἀκράγας in Greek). Consul Manius Valerius Maximus said Corvinus Messalla come from Rome with other soldiers, besiege Syracuse and force Hiero II of Syracuse to ally with Rome.
- 262 B.C. - The Carthaginian forces confine themselves in Agrigentum, the city, besieged by the Romans, is captured after 7 months of siege. Segesta (Ἕγεστα in Greek) ally with Rome.
- 261 B.C. - Roman victory and looting of Agrigentum. The Carthaginians manage to evacuate the garrison. Rome decides to construct a fleet to counteract the Carthaginian domination over the seas. 100 quinqueremes and 20 triremes are being built in the Greek cities' shipyards. 30 000 rowers, mostly Italic/Italiote farmers, are trained to row "virtual ship" in the same order in which, later, would have to row.
- 260 B.C. - First naval battle (the Battle of the Lipari Islands) is a disaster for Rome due to the inexperience of Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio (later said Asina). Immediately thereafter, however, the other consul, Gaius Duilius, wins the battle of Mylae with the help of the "crows."
- 259 B.C. - The terrestrial conflict extends to Sardinia and Corsica where Aleria ( Ἀλαλίη in Greek so you may find it as Alalia) is conquered.
- 258 B.C. - Naval battle of Sulci Tirrenica (Sulci Tyrrhenian), Roman victory. Carthaginian defeated admiral Hannibal Gisco is crucified by his soldiers.
- 257 B.C. - Naval battle of Tyndaris, Roman victory. Rome decides to restart the aggressive policy of Agathocles (the guy who hired Mamertines mercenaries at the beginning of the war). A fleet of 230 ships quinquiremi is built.
- 256 B.C. -  With the new fleet, on which are 97 000 men embarked, the Romans try to invade Africa and Carthage seek to intercept the invasion fleet opposing a fleet of 250 ships with 150 000 men.  The resulting battle of Cape Ecnomus (Ἔκνομος in Greek) is the biggest naval battle of the Antiquity and the greatest victory of Rome. The Roman fleet, led by Consuls Lucius Manlius Vulso "Longus" and Marcus Atilius Regulus in cuneus formation (equivalent of the terrestrial spearhead formation) fit into the Carthaginian formation, risks being surrounded but manage to prevail using the corvus* ( link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_(boarding_device) ). Rome, join naval superiority to terrestrial superiority, land the troops in Africa, in Clupea (or Clypia), and advance towards Carthage. The Battle of Adys and the capture of Tunis with 15 000 men by Atilius Regulus marks the first Roman success in Africa and Carthage sues for peace. The negotiations do not lead to an agreement, and the war continues.
- 255 B.C. - The Carthaginians employ the Spartan General Xanthippus (or Xanthippos, Ξάνθιππος in Greek) to organize the defense. Regulus seek to make peace, but by an error of measurement of the forces, he is defeated in the battle of Tunis. Commander Atilius Regulus is captured, the Roman surviving troops (only 2000 men) reach Clupea and are evacuated by the 350 ships fleet which is however destroyed by a shipwreck during the return to Sicily.
- 254 B.C. - A new 220 ships fleet is built to substitute the previous one that had been destroyed in the storm and a conscription is open to make a new army. The Romans win at Palermo where they make 27,000 prisoners of which 13,000 were sold as slaves, but they fail to take significant steps in the war. Carthaginian counterattack repelled by the forces of Cecilius Metellus, who in his triumph bring back for the first time elephants to Rome. Five Greek cities in Sicily switch from Carthage to Rome.
- 253 B.C. - Rome continues in the policy of bringing war to Africa, on the Syrtan coast, westwards from Carthage. After a year without any significant successes, the fleet returns to the fatherland. During the return, the Romans are once again caught in a storm and lose 150 ships.
- 251 B.C. - New Roman victory at Palermo (Panormus) against the Carthaginians led by Hasdrubal Hanno (https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asdrubale_di_Annone). As a result from the last defeats, Carthage reinforce the garrison in Sicily and reconquer Agrigentum.
- 250 B.C. - The Romans, after having reinforced the garrisons and built a road between Agrigentum and Palermo, start the siege of Lilybaeum with terrestrial forces and 200 ships. Unsuccessfully.
- 249 B.C. - Rome, in a tentative to force the harbour, lose almost all its fleet in the battle of Draepanum. It blames the depressing effect obtained by Consul Publius Claudius Pulcher who had auspicious chicken thrown into the sea after them having not eaten their feed (which is a bad presage). The quote of the Consul "Since they do not wish to eat, let them drink!" (Latin "Bibant, quando esse nollent") became famous. The Consul Lucius Iunius Pullus lose, again in a storm, his fleet, however he manages to conquer Eryx ( Έρυξ  in Greek). Aulus Atilius Calatinus is nominated dictator of the Roman Republic and send to Sicily.
- 248 B.C. - 243 B.C. - Low intensity battles in Sicily. Raids by both sides in enemy territory. Due to the dire economic conditions, Carthage does not manage to get by Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, a loan of 2,000 talents. But Rome isn't rolling in the money too and limits the units needed to 60 ships to contain costs. Hamilcar Barca (father of Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Mago Barca) makes victorious incursions in Sicily and capture Consul Lucius Iunius Pullus. No important naval battles.  Peace tractatives are begun but Marcus Atilius Regulus, who some years earlier sought peace is then sent to Rome to patronize it, guessing that Carthage was almost exhausted, opposes to peace.
- 242 B.C. - With an extreme effort Rome manages to build a new fleet including the use of private financing. 219 ships are built. Carthage is taken by surprise by this recurrence of a war that was dragging with no big news. The Romans manage to occupy Draepanum (the ancient Trapani) and  the harbour Lilybaeum (the ancient Marsala) is bloccaded.
- 241 B.C. - March 10, the Battle of the Aegates (or the Battle of the Egadi Islands https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Aegates) takes place with the decisive victory of Rome. The Carthaginian ships, resupplying cargos for Sicily can not maneuver and flee. Carthage loses 120 ships and 10 000 men are captured. Commander Hanno is prosecuted after the defeat and condemned to death. Carthage is forced to accept the peace conditions. End of the first Punic war.
